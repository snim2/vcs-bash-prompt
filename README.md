vcs-bash-prompt
===============

My custom bash prompt using Version Control Systems (VCS) such as: git, hg, ecc...

Introduction
------------

When I work with VCS at bash command line, on my favorite GNU/Linux distribution, I find useful a custom prompt that display information about the VCS used in a project.

When I am in any directory of a project's directory tree the custom prompt display me:
* which VCS is being used
* which branch I am on
